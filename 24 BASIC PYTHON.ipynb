    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans: def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement."
