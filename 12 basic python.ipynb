PdfFileReader class provides a attribute called isEncrypted to check whether a pdf is encrypted or not. the method returns true if a pdf is encrypted and vice versa.\n",

Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n",

There are a total of 5 levels statring for 0 t0 4. where level 0 makes a headline with the horizontal line below the text, whereas the heading level 1 is the main heading. Similarly, the other headings are sub-heading with their's font-sizes in decreasing order."
